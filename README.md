#e-Elect

The proposed blockchain-based e-voting system addresses numerous challenges inherent in traditional paper-based voting methods. By leveraging blockchain technology, the system ensures transparency, security, and efficiency in the electoral process. It eliminates the need for physical ballot papers, thereby reducing costs associated with printing and transportation. The decentralized nature of the blockchain ensures tamper-resistant recording and tallying of votes, mitigating concerns about fraud and manipulation. Additionally, the system offers accessibility features for voters with disabilities and those in remote areas. Through streamlined digital processes, it minimizes manual counting errors and significantly reduces the time required to announce election results. Overall, the system enhances the integrity, accessibility, and efficiency of the electoral process while reducing its environmental footprint.
